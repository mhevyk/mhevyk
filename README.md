## About me

👨‍💻 My name is **Maksym Hevyk**. I am a junior Frontend/Fullstack developer.

I am a motivated, hardworking, and receptive problem-solver with attention to detail. I am not afraid of challenging tasks, and at the same time, I always think of the most optimal solutions to solve business problems. I enjoy communicating with people and helping them if they need it.
